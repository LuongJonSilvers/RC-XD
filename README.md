Capstone Project for Embedded Microprocessor System Design Course
Partners: Sree, Grant, Val, Akash
This is my capston project for the final semester at the University Of Wisconsin Madison. This project uses C code with a Hardware abstraction layer that is running on a PSoC6. The PSoC6 is a microprocessor that has many features. We were tasked with designing PCB(s), assemblying, coding, debugging, and testing our product. We used Altium Designer and Eclipse IDE for MOdusToolbox for this prject heavily. The project itself is a APP controlled car platform that can take on many hardware modules to change its funcitonality. This car platform comes with a live camera feed, GPS, crash detection, automatic headlights and a designated app for control. For our final demo we decided to equip the bot with a turret that shot water pellets. Originally this repo was on a partners account which I have transeferred here.
